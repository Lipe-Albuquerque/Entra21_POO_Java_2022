# Learning polymorphism
## Polymorphism means multiple shapes
> Various ways to perform legacy behavior

> - Inheritance is required to make the 3 basic forms of polymorphism

> 1. Only leverage inherited behaviors
> 1. Completely make it my way by writing an identical inheritance method
> 1. Override @Override the inherited method
- This form forces my overridden method to have the same syntax as the inheritance
- Can I leverage inherited behavior with "super" and make a difference
- I can enjoy nothing and do it my way
